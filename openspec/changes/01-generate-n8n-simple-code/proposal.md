# Proposal: Generate n8n Simple Code Examples

## Overview
Create a collection of simple, reusable n8n code examples that demonstrate common workflow automation patterns using the Code Node. These examples will serve as templates for building n8n workflows with custom JavaScript logic.

## Motivation
- Provide ready-to-use code snippets for common n8n automation tasks
- Reduce development time by offering tested, working examples
- Demonstrate best practices for using n8n's Code Node
- Enable quick prototyping of workflow automation

## Scope
This change will create simple n8n code examples covering:
1. **Data Manipulation** - Transform and process workflow data
2. **API Integration** - Make HTTP requests and handle responses
3. **Conditional Logic** - Implement decision-making in workflows
4. **Data Formatting** - Convert between different data formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
5. **Error Handling** - Gracefully handle errors in workflows

## Out of Scope
- Complex multi-node workflows
- Custom n8n node development
- Database-specific integrations
- Production deployment configurations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] At least 5 working code examples created
- [ ] Each example includes clear comments and documentation
- [ ] Examples are tested and functional
- [ ] Code follows n8n best practices
- [ ] Examples cover different use cases

## Implementation Approach
1. Research n8n Code Node capabilities and limitations
2. Identify common use cases from n8n documentation
3. Create simple, focused code examples
4. Document each example with usage instructions
5. Test examples in n8n environment (if available)

## Dependencies
- n8n documentation and API reference
- Understanding of n8n's Code Node structure
- JavaScript knowledge

## Timeline
Estimated completion: 1-2 hours

## Notes
- Examples should be simple enough for beginners to understand
- Focus on practical, real-world use cases
- Each example should be self-contained and runnable
